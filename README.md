# Introduction
A mutator utilizing Mian's Custom Flags Framework which allows you to replace Eagle/Raven flags with political flags ranging from countries, to parties, to states, and more!

This mutator is purely for entertainment (and is also just a template for my framework if im being honest). As such, PLEASE do not bring topics up to a real political level. It does not matter what is happening in the real world, ABSOLUTELY separate that from this. These are just goofy red pesky dudes fighting against other goofy blue pesky dudes after all.

There should also be no performance drain whatsoever with this mutator compared to other flag mutators. If you find that there is a significant change in performance, let me know in the issue tracker for the framework this mutator is dependent on.

More information about the framework this mutator is dependent on can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3385310995).

# Credits and Template

The original framework was created by Red and then was initially altered by me to help with performance. If you want to create your own flag mutators with my framework, find a tutorial [here](https://github.com/MianReplicate/Mian-Custom-Flags-Framework).
